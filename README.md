# Quadratic Equation Solver
Hey there, Looking for something to help you with solving the quadratic equation? Here's one I've created -give it a try.
## What is a Quadratic Equation?
    Any equation having *highest degree as 2* is a quadratic equation.
Standard form of *quadratic equation* is;
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
Here, a , b and c are constants 
Quadratic Equation when represted graphically gives us a parabola.

### About Project 
I wanted to try-out a mathematical project using Python and thought of this one. I'm a novice so, keep yourself off from high expectation. 





The project is open to any amendment if you'd like to contribute.
